        Sapa is a small, mountain town in Lao Cai Province. It is located about 350 km northwest of
        Hanoi, close to the
        Chinese border. Here's where you'll find the Hoang Lien Son range of mountains, which includes Fan Si Pan—the
        country's highest peak.
        This quiet Vietnamese town is home to different ethnic tribal groups. There are five main ethnic groups in
        Sapa:
        the Hmong, Dao, Tay, Giay and Xa Pho. It is said that Sapa was first occupied by the first four groups, since
        the
        Vietnamese from the lowlands (better known as the Kinh) did not colonise the highest valleys.
        These days.
      </p>
          <p>
      Sapa welcomes a diverse range of visitors, attracted by the highland tribes, iconic rice paddies and
      forest treks. The whole area is blessed with awe-inspiring natural beauty.
      Hiking and enjoying nature is the name of the game in Sapa. The most prominent attraction in the area around
      Sapa is Fan Si Pan, which is the highest mountain in Vietnam. It's only 19km from town. This may seem like
      a
      short distance, but the trek is not easy; the rough terrain and unpredictable weather present some
      difficulties.
      Tourists who are fit and have mountain climbing experience will enjoy this attraction the most, as the peak is
      accessible all year round. Technical climbing skills are not necessary, but endurance is a must.Fan Si Pan can
      be found in Hoang Lien National Park, which is an attraction in itself.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div class="sapa2">
      <p>The park covers a
        picturesque mountain landscape and several forests, and serves as the habitat for a diverse set of animals. Some
        species can only be found in northwest Vietnam and are highly endangered. Nature lovers will truly appreciate
        this
        park.
        Other attractions that are part of the Hoang Lien National Park include the Cat Cat Village and the Ta Phin
        Village and cave. What to Do in Sapa. Sapa is a small, we highly recomend taking a stroll up and down the
        steep streets of this tiny mountain town.In Sapa town, there's a small museum and a modest cathedral. You may be
        hassled by tribal ladies to buy their
        wares, but it's fun to
        talk to them.

      <p> Sapa Restaurants and Dining Scene
        If you're looking for a good meal in Sapa, head to Cau May Street, which is the main street where most of the
        restaurants and cafés are located.
        Moment Romantic Restaurant is recommended for a good quality Vietnamese meal. The menu is diverse, ingredients
        are
        fresh, and there are many vegetarian options. It's a mid-range restaurant.
        Delta Restaurant is known for its reasonable prices and well-made Italian dishes like pizza and lasagne. They
        also
        serve Vietnamese dishes.
        If you're looking for a local experience, try a Vietnamese hot pot to warm you up on a cold night at Gerbera
        Restaurant. The service occasionally borders on rude, but you can enjoy the rustic charm of this local
        restaurant
        and its authentic décor.
        Visitors with a sweet tooth will love Le Gecko. This establishment's pastries are the best in town. It also
        serves
        light meals. Enjoying a cup of hot chocolate here after a chilly day is a nice treat.
        Other dining spots worth visiting include Nature Bar and Grill, and Rose Garden.</p>

      <img src="images/Rice_field.jpg" alt="Beautiful picture of rice field">
      <p>If you miss the Bac Ha Market, you can wait until Tuesday for
        the Coc Ly Market, which is smaller and less varied.There are a couple of bars offering a place to meet fellow
        travellers, sink a few beers and play a game of pool. Most of the restaurants that sell beer and other drinks
        tend
        to close early in the evening. You can find a few karaoke joints frequented by middle-class Vietnamese
        travellers.
        There are no nightclubs or dance halls.
        The H'mong Sisters is probably the most popular bar in town.
        If you're looking for live music in Sapa, head to the Wooden Pub. The place gets packed when live bands play on
        weekends.  If you want to buy something, bargain hard. The tribal ladies selling the goods can drive a very hard
          bargain.</p>
        <p>Sapa Shopping
          Like most rural areas in Vietnam, there are no shopping malls in Sapa. Instead, shopping takes place at markets
          where locals buy (and sell) an assortment of goods. Fresh ingredients, handicrafts and clothing are plentiful.
          Tourists can also purchase souvenirs. There's also lots of faux-tribal goods that have come stright from a
          factory
          in China.
          Located next to the bus station, Sapa Market is open daily from 06:00 to 14:00. The town is very small, so it's
          easy to find this local market. The most popular day to visit is Saturday. It was made famous mostly because of
          the 'Love Market,' wherein teenagers from the tribes go to town to find a partner. Unfortunately, it has become
          significantly commercial in recent years.
          The Bac Ha Market and Coc Ly Market are good alternatives for those who want to experience shopping the way
          locals
          do without being dampened by commercialisation. If you want to visit these Tribal markets, you should book a day
          tour from a travel agent in town.
          Every Sunday, the different hill tribes that meet in the morning to sell their wares make up the Bac Ha Market.
          Unlike the Saturday Market, this is more about local business than tourism. The market is open until noon, but
          the
          best time to visit is between dawn and late morning.

      <p>Trekking and Hiking in Sapa
        Trekking is the main activity in Sapa. Trekking maps are available from the Tourist Information centre on
        Fansipan
        Street. These maps are invaluable if you want to trek aroundthe area without a guide. They show the walking
        trails
        and trekking routes around town. Most hotels in Sapa offer tourists guided half-day and day long treks, but the
        best places to inquire about these treks are the Cha Pa Garden, Auberge Hotel, Cat Cat View Hotel and Mountain
        View Hotel.
        While it is possible to go hiking around Sapa on your own, it's better to have the assistance of a guide to
        guarantee a more enriching experience.</p>
      <img src="images/Sapa01.jpg" alt="Sapa">
      <p>When it comes to longer treks or overnight stays in the villages, the
        knowledge of a local will come in handy.
        Regardless of being on a walking tour or not, tribal women will walk with you and try to assist you in any
        possible way hoping for a tip.
        Tourists who want to learn something new can go on community-based tours to Sin Chai, a Hmong village. On most
        tours, overnight stays are arranged so people can learn about textiles, or tribal music and dance. History of
        Sapa
        It was only when the French arrived in Tonkin in the 19th century that Sapa was acknowledged and included on the
        national map. The site where Sapa is located became a key location for the French military as well as
        missionaries. For decades, this mountainous backwater was  unknown to tourists, but in 1993 Sapa became
        accessible
        to many when it was formally promoted as a tourists destination.</p>
