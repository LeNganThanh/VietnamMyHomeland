        Vietnam was conventionally considered to be a Buddhist country.[18] Buddhism came to Vietnam as early as the
        second century AD through the North from China and via Southern routes from India. Mahayana Buddhism first
        spread from India via sea to Vietnam around 100 AD. During the 15th and 16th centuries, Theravāda became
        established as the state religion in Cambodia and also spread to Cambodians living in the Mekong Delta,
        replaced
        Mahayana. although some
        ethnic minorities (such as the Khmer Krom in the southern Delta region of Vietnam) adhere to the Theravada
        school. </p>
      <p>Buddhism as practiced by the ethnic Vietnamese is mainly of the Mahayana school
        Today, more than half of the Vietnamese population, consider themselves as adherents of Mahayana Buddhism.
        Theravada and Hòa Hảo Buddhism are also present in significant numbers. Buddhist practice in Vietnam differs
        from that of other Asian countries, and does not contain the same institutional structures, hierarchy, or
        sanghas that exist in other traditional Buddhist settings. It has instead grown from a symbiotic relationship
        with Taoism, Chinese spirituality, and the indigenous Vietnamese religion, with the majority of Buddhist
        practitioners focusing on devotional rituals rather than meditation.
        The triple
        religion (Vietnamese: tam giáo), referring to the syncretic combination of Mahayana Buddhism, Confucianism,
        and
        Taoism, and Vietnamese folk religion (often assimilated), remain a strong influence on the beliefs and
        practices
        of the Vietnamese, even if the levels of formal membership in these religious communities may not reflect that
        influence. One of the most notable and universal spiritual practices common to Vietnamese is ancestor
        veneration. It is considered an expression of hiếu thảo (filial piety), a key virtue to maintain a harmonious
        society.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="church">
      <p> According to estimates by the Pew Research Center in 2010, most of the Vietnamese people
        practiced (exclusively)
        folk religions (45.3%). 16.4% of the population were Buddhists, 8.2% were Christians, and about 30% were
        unaffiliated to any religion.Officially, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is an atheist state, as declared
        by its communist government.
        Although according to a 1999 census most Vietnamese list themselves as having no religious affiliation,
        religion, as defined by shared beliefs and practices, remains an integral part of Vietnamese life, dictating
        the social behaviours and spiritual practices of Vietnamese individuals in Vietnam and abroad. </p>
      <img src="images/VN_church.jpg" alt="Church for Christians">
      <p> These offerings
        and practices are done frequently during important
        traditional or religious celebrations (e.g., death anniversaries), the starting of a new business, or even
        when
        a family member needs guidance or counsel. According to statistics from the Government Committee for Religious
        Affairs, as of 2018,
        Buddhists account for
        14.9% of the total population, Christians 8.5% (Catholics 7.4% & Protestants 1.1%), Hoahao Buddhists 1.5%, and
        Caodaism followers 1.2%.[1] Other religions include Hinduism, Islam, and Baháí Faith, representing less than
        0.2% of the population. Folk religions (worship of ancestors, gods and goddesses), not included in government
        statistics, have experienced revival since the 1980s.
        Regardless of formal religious affiliation, it is very common to have an altar in the home and business where
        prayers are offered to their ancestors. Belief in ghosts and spirits is very common; many believe that the
        traditions are important links to culture and history and are enjoyable, while others believe that failing to
        perform the proper rituals for one's ancestors will literally cause them to become hungry ghosts (Vietnamese:
        ma
        đói).</p>

    <div class="mosque">
      <p>
        The majority of Vietnamese do not follow any organized religion, instead participating in one or more
        practices
        of folk religions, such as venerating ancestors, or praying to deities, especially during Tết and other
        festivals. Folk religions were founded on endemic cultural beliefs that were historically affected by
        Confucianism and Taoism from China, as well as by various strands of Buddhism.</p>
      <p> These three teachings or tam
        giáo
        were later joined by Christianity which has become a significant presence. Vietnam is also home of two
        indigenous religions: syncretic Caodaism and quasi-Buddhist Hoahaoism.
        Government statistics of the religion in Vietnam, are counts of members of religious organization recognized
        by
        the government. </p>
      <p> Hence, this does not include people practicing folk religion, which is not recognized by
        government. Also, many people practice religion such as Buddhism without taking any membership of specific
        government organization. Official statistics from the 2019 Census, also not categorizing folk religion,
        indicates that Catholicism is the largest (organized) religion in Vietnam, surpassing Buddhism. While some
        other
        surveys reported 45-50 millions Buddhist living in Vietnam, the government statistics counts for 6.8
        millions. It is the Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam, however, does not reports official statistics on its
        adherents. The great gaps in statistics on the number of Buddhist adherents is due to disagreement on the very
        criteria of what constitute a Buddhist.
        The decorations on
        Dong Son bronze drums, generally agreed to have ceremonial and possibly religious value, depict the
        figures of birds, leading historians to believe birds were objects of worship for the early Vietnamese.
        Dragons
        were another frequently recurring figure in Vietnamese art, arising from the veneration of Lạc Long Quân, a
        mythical dragon-king who is said to be the father of the Vietnamese people. The Golden Turtle God Kim Quy was
        said to appear to kings in times of crisis, notably to Lê Lợi, from whom he took the legendary sword Thuận
        Thiên
        after it had been dropped into Hoan Kiem Lake. </p>
