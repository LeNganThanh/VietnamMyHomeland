  <main aria-label="Beautiful white sand beach island in the south of Vietnam">
    <div class="phuquoc1">
      <p>Phú Quốc is the largest island in Vietnam. Phú Quốc and nearby islands, along with the
        distant Thổ Chu Islands, are part of Kiên Giang Province as Phú Quốc City, the island has a total area of 574
        km2
        (222 sq mi) and a permanent population of approximately 179,480 people. Located in the Gulf of Thailand, the
        island city of Phú Quốc includes the island proper and 21 smaller islets. Dương Đông ward is located on the west
        coast, and is also the administrative and largest town on the island. The other ward is An Thới on the southern
        tip of the island. </p>
      <p>
        Its primary industries are fishing, agriculture, and a fast-growing tourism sector. Phú Quốc has achieved fast
        economic growth due to its current tourism boom. Many infrastructure projects have been carried out, including
        several five-star hotels and resorts. Phú Quốc International Airport is the hub connecting Phú Quốc with
        mainland
        Vietnam and other international destinations.
        From March 2014, Vietnam allowed all foreign tourists to visit Phú Quốc visa-free for a period of up to 30
        days. By 2017, the government of Vietnam planned to set up a Special Administrative Region which covered Phú
        Quốc Island and peripheral islets and upgrade it to a provincial city with special administration.
        The historical Phú Quốc Prison was based here; the prison was built by French colonialists to detain captured
        Viet
        Cong and North Vietnamese soldiers.</p>

    <div class="phuquoc2">
      <p>Phú Quốc lies south of the Cambodian coast, south of Kampot, and 40 kilometres (22 nmi) west of Hà Tiên, the
        nearest coastal town in Vietnam. Roughly triangular in shape the island is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long from north
        to south and 25 kilometres (16 mi) from east to west at its widest. It is also located 17 nautical miles (31 km)
        from Kampot, 62 nautical miles (115 km) from Rạch Giá and nearly 290 nautical miles (540 km) from Laem Chabang,
        Thailand. A mountainous ridge known as "99 Peaks" runs the length of Phú Quốc, with Chúa Mountain being the
        tallest at 603
        metres (1,978 ft).
        Phú Quốc Island is mainly composed of sedimentary rocks from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic age, including
        heterogeneous conglomerate composition, layering thick, quartz pebbles, silica, limestone, rhyolite and felsite.
        The Mesozoic rocks are classified in Phú Quốc Formation (K pq). The Cenozoic sediments are classified in
        formations of Long Toàn (middle - upper Pleistocene), Long Mỹ (upper Pleistocene), Hậu Giang (lower - middle
        Holocene), upper Holocene sediments, and undivided Quaternary (Q). The city of Phu Quoc is officially divided
        into
        nine commune-level sub-divisions, including two urban wards (Dương Đông, An Thới) and seven rural communes (Bãi
        Thơm, Cửa Cạn, Cửa Dương). </p>
      <img src="images/Phuquoc04.jpg" alt="Phuquoc from helicopter view">
      <p> Phú Quốc is famous for its two traditional products: fish sauce and black pepper. The rich fishing grounds
        offshore provides the anchovy catch from which the prized sauce is made.
        As widely agreed among the Vietnamese
        people, the best fish sauce comes from Phú Quốc. The island name is very coveted and abused in the fish sauce
        industry that local producers have been fighting for the protection of its appellation of origin. Pepper is
        cultivated everywhere on the island, especially at Gành Dầu and Cửa Dương communes. </p>

    <div class="phuquoc3">
      <p>The pearl farming activity
        began more than 20 years ago when Australian and Japanese experts arrived to develop the industry with advanced
        technology. Some Vietnamese pearl farms were established at that time including Quốc An.
        Tourism plays an important role in the economy, with the beaches being the main attraction. Phú Quốc was served
        by
        Phú Quốc Airport with air links to Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) Tan Son Nhat International Airport, Hanoi (Noi Bai
        International Airport), Rạch Giá (Rạch Giá Airport) and Can Tho (Can Tho International Airport). Phú Quốc
        Airport
        was closed and replaced by the new Phú Quốc International Airport from December 2, 2012. Phú Quốc is also
        linked with Rạch Giá and Hà Tiên by fast ferry hydrofoils. Air Mekong used to have its headquarters in An Thới. Many domestic and international projects related to tourism
        have been carried out, including the latest direct
        flights from Bangkok to Phú Quốc by Bangkok Airways, which could make Phú Quốc a new tourist hub in Southeast
        Asia.</p>
      <img src="images/Phuquoc03.jpg" alt="Phuquoc white sand beach with palme tree">
      <p>
       
        With the combination of Vinpearl Phú Quốc Resorts and the opening of the new Vinmec Phú Quốc International
        Hospital in June 2015, Phú Quốc will add an additional source of revenue to the local economy in terms of
        medical
        services, medical tourism, and medical education.
        The earliest Cambodian references to Phú Quốc (known as Koh Tral) are found in royal documents dated 1615
        [citation
        needed], however no one has offered compelling evidence that Khmers have ever had a substantial presence there,
        or
        that a state exercised authority. For many Khmers the case of Koh Tral is one of history imagined rather than
        remembered.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center; padding: 1rem;">
      The island's monsoonal sub-equatorial climate is characterized by distinct rainy (April to November) and dry
      seasons
      (December to March).

    <p class="phuquocSS">Phú Quốc has both a terrestrial national park and a marine protection.
      Phú Quốc National Park was established in 2001 as an upgrade of a former conservation zone. The park covers 336.57
      km2 (129.95 sq mi) of the northern part of the island.
      Phú Quốc Marine Protected Area, or just Phú Quốc MPA, was established in 2007 at the northern and southern end of
      the island and covers 187 km2 (72 sq mi) of marine area. The sea around Phú Quốc is one of the richest fishing
      grounds in all of Vietnam, and the aim of the protected area is to secure coral reef zones, seagrass beds, and
      mangrove forests, all key spawning and nursery grounds for aquatic species, including blue swimming crabs. Among
      the
      aquatic animals in the protected area are green turtle, leather back turtles, dolphin and dugong.
      Plastic waste is a growing problem in Phú Quốc, and the local community has organized clean-up efforts.
      Western record in 1856 again mentioned the island: "... King Ang Duong (of Cambodia) apprize Mr. de Montigny,
      French
      envoy in visit to Bangkok, through the intermediary of Bishop Miche, his intention to yield Phu Quoc to
      France."[19]
      Such a proposition aimed to create a military alliance with France to avoid the threat of Vietnam on Cambodia. The
      proposal did not receive an answer from the French.[20] An 1856 publication by The Nautical Magazine describes Phu
      Quoc to still be part of Cambodia even though it was occupied by the Cochinchinese. The quote from the publication
      is:
      The whole of the island is thickly wooded, and only the shore parts appear to be inhabited, principally by
      Cochinchinese, for although in the empire of Cambodia it has been seized upon by the unscrupulous inhabitants of
      Cancao."</p>
    <p class="phuquocSS">
      While the war between Vietnam and France was about to begin, Ang Duong sent another letter, dated November 25,
      1856,
      to Napoleon III to warn him on Cambodian claims on the lower Cochinchina region: the Cambodian king listed
      provinces
      and islands, including Phú Quốc, as being parts of Vietnam for several years or decades (in the case of Saigon
      some
      200 years). Ang Duong asked the French emperor to not annex any part of these territories because, as he wrote,
      despite this relatively long Vietnamese rule, they remained Cambodian lands. In 1867, Phú Quốc's Vietnamese
      authorities pledged allegiance to French troops just conquering Hà Tiên.
      In 1939, Governor General of French Indochina, Jules Brévié, sent a letter to the Governor of Cochinchina about
      “the
      issue of the islands in the Gulf of Siam whose is a matter of controversy between Cambodia and Cochin-China”. In
      this letter,“for administrative purposes”, he drew a line which defined the border between the waters of Cambodia
      and Cochin-China: all the islands north of the line are under Cambodian sovereignty, all the islands south of the
      line are ruled by Cochin-China. As a result, Phú Quốc remained under Cochinchina administration. In 1949,
      Cochin-China became part of Vietnam, an Associated State in the French Union within the Indochinese Federation.
      After the Geneva Accords, in 1954, Cochinchina's sovereignty was handed over to Vietnam.
      After Mainland China fell under the control of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949, General Huang Chieh moved
      33,000+ Republic of China Army soldiers mostly from Hunan Province to Vietnam and they were interned on Phú Quốc.
      Later, the army moved to Taiwan in June 1953.
      In 1964, then Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk proposed to the Vietnamese a map aimed at settling the issue.
      Cambodia offered to accept the colonial “Brévié Line” as the maritime boundary, thus abandoning its claim to Koh
      Trâl. That position of Cambodia was confirmed by maps given to the mission sent by the UN Security Council after
      the
      Chantrea incidents. On June 8, 1967, the Vietnamese issued a declaration that accepted the “Brévié Line” as the
      maritime border.</p>
