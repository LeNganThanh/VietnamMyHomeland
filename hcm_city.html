          Ho Chi Minh City, commonly and formerly officially known as Saigon,
          is the largest city in Vietnam, situated in the south. In the
          southeastern region, the city surrounds the Saigon River and covers
          about 2,061 square kilometres (796 square miles). Prior to
          Vietnamese settlement in the 17th century, the city was a scarcely
          populated area that had been part of historic empires of Funan,
          Chenla, and Cambodia. With the arrival of Vietnamese, the area
          became more populated and officials began establishing the city from
          1623 to 1698. After it was ceded by the last Vietnamese dynasty to
          the French in 1862, the name Saigon was adopted and the city
          underwent urbanization to become a financial center in the region.
          The city was the capital of South Vietnam until the end of the
          Vietnam War with North Vietnamese victory in 1975. In 1976, the
          government of the unified Vietnam renamed Saigon in honor of Hồ Chí
          Minh.The primary economic center of Vietnam, it is also an emerging
          international destination.

          Ho Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its
          history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and
          political groups. Originally a trading port city of the Khmer Empire
          known as Prey Nokor, it is still known as Prey Nokor to Cambodians
          today. In time, under the control of the Vietnamese, it was
          officially renamed Gia Dinh (嘉定), a name that was retained until
          the time of the French conquest in the 1860s, when it adopted the
          name Sài Gòn, westernized as Saïgon, although the city was still
          indicated as 嘉定 on Vietnamese maps written in Chữ Hán until at
          least 1891. The current name, Ho Chi Minh City, was given after
          reunification in 1976 to honor Ho Chi Minh.[nb 1] Even today,
          however, the informal name of Sài Gòn remains in daily speech.
          However, there is a technical difference between the two terms:
          <!--  Sài
            Gòn is commonly used to refer to the city center in District 1 and
            the adjacent areas, while Ho Chi Minh City refers to all of its
            urban and rural districts. -->

          The earliest settlement in the area was a Funan temple at the
          location of the current Phụng Sơn Buddhist temple, founded in the
          4th century AD. A settlement called Baigaur was established on the
          site in the 11th century by the Champa. Baigaur was renamed Nokor
          around 1145, Nokor grew on the site of a small fishing village and
          area of forest. The first Vietnamese people crossed the sea to
          explore this land completely without the organization of the Nguyễn
          Lords. Thanks to the marriage between Princess Nguyễn Phúc Ngọc Vạn
          - daughter of Lord Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên - and the King of Cambodia
          Chettha II in 1620, the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia
          became smooth, and the people of the two countries could freely move
          back and forth. Vietnamese settlers began to migrate to the area of
          Dong Nai. Before that the Funanese, Khmer, and Cham had lived there.

        (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name
        commemorates Ho Chi Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This
        name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his
        later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (Hồ, 胡) with a
        given name meaning "enlightened will" (from Sino-Vietnamese 志 明; Chí
        meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and Minh meaning 'light'), in essence,
        meaning "light bringer". Nowadays, "Saigon" is commonly used to refer
        to the city's central business districts, whereas "Ho Chi Minh City"
        is used to refer to the whole city.

        Scattered from time immemorial. The period from 1623 to 1698 is
        considered the period of the formation of later Saigon. In 1623, Lord
        Nguyen sent a mission to ask his son-in-law, King Chey Chettha II, to
        set up tax collection stations in Prey Nokor (Saigon) and Kas Krobei
        (Ben Nghe). Alhough this was a deserted jungle area, it was located on
        the traffic routes of Vietnamese, Chinese,... to Cambodia and Siam.
        The next two important events of this period were the establishment of
        the barracks and residence of Vice King Ang Non and the establishment
        of a palace at Tan My (near the present-day Cong Quynh – Nguyen Trai
        crossroads). It can be said that Saigon was formed from these three
        government agencies. </p>

        In 1949, former Emperor Bảo Đại made Saigon the capital of the State
        of Vietnam with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva
        Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (Bến Hải River),
        with the communist Việt Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete
        control of the northern half of the country, while the southern half
        gaining independence from France. The State officially became the
        Republic of Vietnam when Bảo Đại was deposed by his Prime Minister Ngô
        Đình Diệm in the 1955 referendum, with Saigon as its capital. On 22
        October 1956, the city was given the official name, Đô Thành Sài Gòn
        ("Capital City Saigon"). After the decree of 27 March 1959 came into
        effect, Saigon was divided into eight districts and 41 wards. In
        December 1966, two wards from old An Khánh Commune of Gia Định, were
        formed into District 1, then seceded shortly later to became District
        9. In July 1969, District 10 and District 11 were founded, and by
        1975, the city's area consisted of eleven districts, Gia Định, Củ Chi
        District (Hậu Nghĩa) and Phú Hòa District (Bình Dương). Saigon served
        as the financial, industrial and transport center of the Republic of
        Vietnam. In the late 1950s, with the U.S. providing nearly $2 billion
        in aid to the Diệm regime, the country's economy grew rapidly under
        capitalism; by 1960, over half of South Vietnam's factories were
        located in Saigon. However, beginning in the 1960s, Saigon experienced
        economic downturn and high inflation, as it was completely dependent
        to U.S. aids and imports from other countries. As a result of
        widespread urbanization, with the population reaching 3.3 million by
        1970, the city was described by the USAID as being turned "into a huge
        slum". The city was also suffered from "prostitutes, drug addicts,
        corrupt officials, beggars, orphans, and Americans with money", and
        according to Stanley Karnow, it was "a black-market city in the
        largest sense of the word". On 28 April 1955, the Vietnamese National
        Army launched an attack against Bình Xuyên military force in the city.
        The battle lasted until May, killing an estimated 500 people and
        leaving about 20,000 homeless. Ngô Đình Diệm then later turned on
        other paramilitary groups in Saigon, including the Hoa Hao Buddhist
        reform movement. On 11 June 1963, Buddhist monk Thích Quảng Đức burned
        himself in the city, in protest of the Diệm regime. On 1 November of
        the same year, Diệm was assassinated in Saigon, in a successful coup
        by Dương Văn Minh. During the 1968 Tet Offensive, communist forces
        launched a failed attempt to capture the city. On 30 April 1975,
        Saigon fell, ending the Vietnam War with a victory for North Vietnam,
        and the city came under the control of the Vietnamese People's Army.
