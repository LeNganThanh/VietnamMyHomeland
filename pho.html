        Pho originated in the early 20th century in northern Vietnam, and was popularized throughout the world by
        refugees
        after the Vietnam War. Because pho's origins are poorly documented, there is disagreement over the cultural
        influences that led to its development in Vietnam, as well as the etymology of the name. The Hanoi (northern)
        and Saigon (southern) styles of pho differ by noodle width, sweetness of broth, and choice of herbs.
        Pho likely evolved from similar noodle. <br>For example, villagers in Vân Cù say they ate pho long before the
        French colonial period. The modern form emerged between 1900 and 1907 in northern Vietnam, southeast of
        Hanoi in Nam Định Province, then a substantial textile market. The traditional home of pho is reputed to be the
        villages of Vân Cù and Dao Cù (or Giao Cù) in Đông Xuân commune, Nam Trực District, Nam Định Province.

        Pho was originally sold at dawn and dusk by itinerant street vendors, who shouldered mobile kitchens on carrying
        poles (gánh phở).[15] From the pole hung two wooden cabinets, one housing a cauldron over a wood fire, the other
        storing noodles, spices, cookware, and space to prepare a bowl of pho. The heavy gánh was always shouldered by
        men.[16] They kept their heads warm with distinctive, disheveled felt hats called mũ phở.[17]

        Hanoi's first two fixed pho stands were a Vietnamese-owned Cát Tường on Cầu Gỗ Street and a Chinese-owned stand
        in
        front of Bờ Hồ tram stop. They were joined in 1918 by two more on Quạt Row and Đồng Row.[18] Around 1925, a Vân
        Cù
        villager named Vạn opened the first "Nam Định style" pho stand in Hanoi.[19] Gánh phở declined in number around
        1936–1946 in favor of stationary eateries

       Cultural historian and researcher Trịnh Quang Dũng believes that the popularization and origins of modern pho
        stemmed from the intersection of several historical and cultural factors in the early 20th century. <br> These
        include improved availability of beef due to French demand, which in turn produced beef bones that were
        purchased
        by Chinese workers to make into a dish similar to pho called ngưu nhục phấn.

        In the late 1920s, various vendors experimented with húng lìu, sesame oil, tofu, and even Lethocerus indicus
        extract
        (cà cuống). This "phở cải lương" failed to enter the mainstream.
        Phở tái, served with rare beef, had been introduced by 1930. Chicken pho appeared in 1939, possibly because beef
        was
        not sold at the markets on Mondays and Fridays at the time.
        With the partition of Vietnam in 1954, over a million people fled North Vietnam for South Vietnam. Pho,
        previously
        unpopular in the South, suddenly became popular. No longer confined to northern culinary traditions, variations
        in meat and broth appeared, and additional garnishes, such as lime, mung bean sprouts (giá đỗ), culantro (ngò
        gai),
        cinnamon basil (húng quế), Hoisin sauce (tương đen), and hot Sriracha sauce (tương ớt) became standard
        fare. Phở tái also began to rival fully cooked phở chín in popularity. Migrants from the North similarly
        popularized bánh mì sandwiches.
        Meanwhile, in North Vietnam, private pho restaurants were nationalized (mậu dịch quốc doanh) and began serving
        pho noodles made from old rice. Street vendors were forced to use noodles made of imported potato flour.
        Officially banned as capitalism, these vendors prized portability, carrying their wares on gánh and setting out
        plastic stools for customers.</p>
      <p>
        During the so-called "subsidy period" following the Vietnam War, state-owned pho eateries served a meatless
        variety
        of the dish known as "pilotless pho" (phở không người lái), in reference to the U.S. Air Force's unmanned
        reconnaissance drones. The broth consisted of boiled water with MSG added for taste, as there were often
        shortages
        on various foodstuffs like meat and rice during that period. Bread or cold rice was often served as a side dish,
        leading to the present-day practice of dipping quẩy in pho.
        Pho eateries were privatized as part of Đổi Mới. Many street vendors must still maintain a light footprint to
        evade
        police enforcing the street tidiness rules that replaced the ban on private ownership.
        n the aftermath of the Vietnam War, Vietnamese refugees brought pho to many countries. Restaurants specializing
        in
        pho appeared in numerous Asian enclaves and Little Saigons, such as in Paris and in major cities in the United
        States, Canada and Australia.In 1980, the first of hundreds of pho restaurants opened in the Little Saigon
        in Orange County, California.</p>
      <p>
        In the United States, pho began to enter the mainstream during the 1990s, as relations between the U.S. and
        Vietnam
        improved. At that time Vietnamese restaurants began opening quickly in Texas and California, spreading rapidly
        along the Gulf and West Coasts, as well as the East Coast and the rest of the country. During the 2000s, pho
        restaurants in the United States generated US$500 million in annual revenue, according to an unofficial
        estimate. Pho can now be found in cafeterias at many college and corporate campuses, especially on the West
        Coast.
        The word "pho" was added to the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary in 2007. Pho is listed at number 28 on
        "World's 50 most delicious foods" compiled by CNN Go in 2011. The Vietnamese Embassy in Mexico celebrated Pho
        Day on April 3, 2016, with Osaka Prefecture holding a similar commemoration the following day. Pho has been
        adopted by other Southeast Asian cuisines, including Lao and Hmong cuisine. It sometimes appears as "Phô" on
        menus in Australia.
