  <main aria-label="The information about Vietnamese language">
    <section class="language">
      <p>Vietnamese (Vietnamese: tiếng Việt) is an Austroasiatic language that originated in Vietnam, where it is the
        national and official language. Vietnamese is spoken natively by over 70 million people, several times as many
        as
        the rest of the Austroasiatic family combined. It is the native language of the Vietnamese (Kinh) people, as
        well
        as a second language or first language for other ethnic groups in Vietnam. As a result of emigration, Vietnamese
        speakers are also found in other parts of Southeast Asia, East Asia, North America, Europe, and Australia.
        Vietnamese has also been officially recognized as a minority language in the Czech Republic.

        Like many other languages in Southeast Asia and East Asia, Vietnamese is an analytic language with phonemic
        tone.
        It
        has head-initial directionality, with subject–verb–object order and modifiers following the words they modify.
        It
        also uses noun classifiers. Its vocabulary has had significant influence from Chinese and French.
        Vietnamese was historically written using Chữ Nôm, a logographic script using Chinese characters (Chữ Hán) to
        represent Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary and some native Vietnamese words, together with many locally-invented
        characters to represent other words. French colonial rule of Vietnam led to the official adoption of the
        Vietnamese alphabet (Chữ Quốc ngữ) which is based on Latin script. It uses digraphs and diacritics to mark tones
        and
        some phonemes.Early linguistic work some 150 years ago classified Vietnamese as belonging to the Mon
      </p>
      <div class="subPara">
        <p> Khmer branch of the
          Austroasiatic language family (which also includes the Khmer language spoken in Cambodia, as well as various
          smaller
          and/or regional languages, such as the Munda and Khasi languages spoken in eastern India, and others in Laos,
          southern China and parts of Thailand). Later, Muong was found to be more closely related to Vietnamese than
          other
          Mon–Khmer languages, and a Viet–Muong subgrouping was established, also including Thavung, Chut, Cuoi, etc.
          The
          term "Vietic" was proposed by Hayes (1992), who proposed to redefine Viet–Muong as referring to a subbranch of
          Vietic containing only Vietnamese and Muong. The term "Vietic" is used, among others, by Gérard Diffloth, with
          a
          slightly different proposal on subclassification, within which the term "Viet–Muong" refers to a lower
          subgrouping
          (within an eastern Vietic branch) consisting of Vietnamese dialects, Muong dialects, and Nguồn (of Quảng Bình
          Province).Vietnamese belongs to the Northern (Viet–Muong) clusters of the Vietic branch, spoken by the Vietic
          peoples.
          In the distant past, Vietnamese shared more characteristics common to other languages in South East Asia and
          with
          the Austroasiatic family, such as an inflectional morphology and a richer set of consonant clusters, which
          have
          subsequently disappeared from the language under Chinese influence. Vietnamese is heavily influenced by its
          location in the Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area, with the result that it has acquired or converged
          toward characteristics such as isolating morphology and phonemically distinctive tones, through processes of
          tonogenesis.</p>
        <img src="images/Ao dai.jpg" alt="Traditional dress for Vietnamese wormen">
        <p>These characteristics have become
          part of many of the genetically unrelated languages of Southeast Asia; for
          example, Tsat (a member of the Malayo-Polynesian group within Austronesian), and Vietnamese each developed
          tones
          as a phonemic feature. The ancestor of the Vietnamese language is usually believed to have been originally
          based
          in the area of the Red River Delta in what is now northern Vietnam.Distinctive tonal variations emerged during
          the subsequent expansion of the Vietnamese language and people into
          what is now central and southern Vietnam through conquest of the ancient nation of Champa and the Khmer people
          of
          the Mekong Delta in the vicinity of present-day Ho Chi Minh City, also known as Saigon.
          Vietnamese was primarily influenced by Chinese, which came to predominate politically in the 2nd century BC.
          After
          Vietnam achieved independence in the 10th century, the ruling class adopted Classical Chinese as the formal
          medium
          of government, scholarship and literature. With the dominance of Chinese came radical importation of Chinese
          vocabulary and grammatical influence. A portion of the Vietnamese lexicon in all realms consists of
          Sino-Vietnamese words (They are about a third of the Vietnamese lexicon, and may account for as much as 60% of
          the
          vocabulary used in formal texts.)
          When France invaded Vietnam in the late 19th century, French gradually replaced Chinese as the official
          language
          in education and government. Vietnamese adopted many French terms, such as đầm (dame, from madame), ga (train
          station, from gare), sơ mi (shirt, from chemise), and búp bê (doll, from poupée).</p>
      </div>
      <p>Glottal-ending syllables ended with a glottal stop, while fricative-ending syllables ended with /s/ or /h/.
        Both types of syllables could co-occur with a resonant (e.g. /m/ or /n/).
        At some point, a tone split occurred, as in many other Southeast Asian languages. Essentially, an allophonic
        distinction developed in the tones, whereby the tones in syllables with voiced initials were pronounced
        differently
        from those with voiceless initials. (Approximately speaking, the voiced allotones were pronounced with
        additional
        breathy voice or creaky voice and with lowered pitch. The quality difference predominates in today's northern
        varieties, e.g. in Hanoi, while in the southern varieties the pitch difference predominates, as in Ho Chi Minh
        City.) Subsequent to this, the plain-voiced stops became voiceless and the allotones became new phonemic tones.
        Note
        that the implosive stops were unaffected, and in fact developed tonally as if they were unvoiced. (This behavior
        is
        common to all East Asian languages with implosive stops.)
        As noted above, Proto-Viet–Muong had sesquisyllabic words with an initial minor syllable (in addition to, and
        independent of, initial clusters in the main syllable). When a minor syllable occurred, the main syllable's
        initial
        consonant was intervocalic and as a result suffered lenition, becoming a voiced fricative. The minor syllables
        were
        eventually lost, but not until the tone split had occurred. As a result, words in modern Vietnamese with voiced
        fricatives occur in all six tones, and the tonal register reflects the voicing of the minor-syllable prefix and
        not
        the voicing of the main-syllable stop in Proto-Viet–Muong that produced the fricative. For similar reasons,
        words
        beginning with /l/ and /ŋ/ occur in both registers. (Thompson 1976 reconstructed voiceless resonants to account
        for outcomes where resonants occur with a first-register tone, but this is no longer considered necessary, at
        least
        by Ferlus.)
        Old Vietnamese/Ancient Vietnamese was a Vietic language which was separated from Viet–Muong around 9th century,
        and
        evolved to Middle Vietnamese by 16th century. The sources for the reconstruction of Old Vietnamese are Nom
        texts,
        such as the 12th-century/1486 Buddhist scripture Phật thuyết Đại báo phụ mẫu ân trọng kinh ("Sūtra explained by
        the
        Buddha on the Great Repayment of the Heavy Debt to Parents"), old inscriptions, and late 13th-century (possibly
        1293) Annan Jishi glossary by Chinese diplomat Chen Fu (c. 1259 – 1309). Old Vietnamese used Chinese characters
        phonetically where each word, monosyllabic in Modern Vietnamese, is written with two Chinese characters or in a
        composite character made of two different characters.
        The writing system used for Vietnamese is based closely on the system developed by Alexandre de Rhodes for his
        1651
        Dictionarium Annamiticum Lusitanum et Latinum. It reflects the pronunciation of the Vietnamese of Hanoi at that
        time, a stage commonly termed Middle Vietnamese (tiếng Việt trung đại). The pronunciation of the "rime" of the
        syllable, i.e. all parts other than the initial consonant (optional /w/ glide, vowel nucleus, tone and final
        consonant), appears nearly identical between Middle Vietnamese and modern Hanoi pronunciation. On the other
        hand,
        the Middle Vietnamese pronunciation of the initial consonant differs greatly from all modern dialects, and in
        fact
        is significantly closer to the modern Saigon dialect than the modern Hanoi dialect.
        As the national language, Vietnamese is the lingua franca in Vietnam. It is also spoken by the Gin traditionally
        residing on three islands (now joined to the mainland) off Dongxing in southern Guangxi Province, China. A large
        number of Vietnamese speakers also reside in neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos.
        In the United States, Vietnamese is the fifth most spoken language, with over 1.5 million speakers, who are
        concentrated in a handful of states. It is the third most spoken language in Texas and Washington; fourth in
        Georgia, Louisiana, and Virginia; and fifth in Arkansas and California. Vietnamese is the seventh most spoken
        language in Australia. In France, it is the most spoken Asian language and the eighth most spoken immigrant
        language at home</p>
